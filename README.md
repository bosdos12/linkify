# linkify
Open Source Project Every Week Challenge - Week 1 - Finished!

Try it out here: https://adakslinkify.netlify.app/

Built a URL shortener with dynamic editable links and a dynamic QR Code generator.

The tech I used is: MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js, HTML, CSS, JS.

NOTE: The url "www.dicards.co" is the source of the shortened URL's, as that is just a server I have laying around to use for personal projects like this.
